I am a person who likes to program.  Well, not specifically the act of programming, but the act of creating something that solves a problem. 

In my youth, I wrote BASIC on a Commodore 64.  I got so drawn in to that, I eventually got a book on assembly language to see how far I could take it.  Since I was like...10, I couldn't take it too far.  Plus, I was living in podunk nowhere land, and it wasn't like you could run up the street and get a few good books on Assembly Language.  If I had had Google and Codeacademy during my formitive years, lord knows what I'd be into today.

Anyway, people ask me what language(s) I prefer and why all the time.  As I've aged, I've come up with the best possible answer I can give - I have a current preference for Python, but I'm not married to or utterly dogmatic about any language.  I have a strong dislike for Java, but otherwise...it's all the same to me.

The reason I feel that way is that languages come and grow and go and change - you'd be a fool to adamantly *only* like one.

The real work in being someone who codes is understanding things like program flow, variable scope and data structures.  If you have a handle on these things, you can hack things together in almost any language.

What I am striving to be is a domain expert in one or two languages vs. a Jack of All Trades.  I think it's a good goal.  And I'd like to pick Python and/or Ruby to focus on for a while.  But my job is PHP, so there is a little disconnect there.  But I have flexibility where I am - so I can achieve these goals.

So, in summary.  I like creating and solving problems, and languages are just tools.  I have a lot of tools.  I tell people who ask me to not focus on the hammer, but on how to actually build the house.
