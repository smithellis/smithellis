I own a lot of domains.  I'm not a domain squatter on purpose; I've bought each domain with the intention of executing a good idea there.  And then...didn't.

So, the plan goes:

1. Buy domain
2. ?
3. Profit

Bad plan.  So I'm trying to spin up a few of my domains.  It's hard to do, it turns out.  A single site would take a bit of time, but...50?

So I'm looking into ways to revitalize my cool domains, and let go of the domains I can't use.  It's hard.  Think "Hoarder".

Anywho, I own amazing domains and I hope to share them with you soon.
