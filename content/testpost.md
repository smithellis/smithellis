#Pelican is Good

I've just gotten off the ground with the [Pelican Static Site Generator]("http://blog.getpelican.com/").  It's really clever.

Instead of the complexities of a robust CMS, you get a website composed of flat files.  Deployable almost anywhere, fast and built to last.  

You compose you articles or pages in the editor of your choice, and you can use Markdown - which is awesome.  After you've dropped your new page/article in the appropriate folder, a simple command generates your site.  You can even have that simple command generate and deploy your site!  Booya!

All in all, as Paul McLanahan told me, we go backwards to go forward.  Flat file sites are the old future.
