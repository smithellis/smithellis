# Raspberry Pi 2 In Stock

[Adafruit][1] had some Raspberry Pi 2s come back into stock - go check it out!

The new device has everything you loved about the original, but adds a faster CPU (quad core 900 MHz ARMv7) and 1gig of RAM!  Whoo hoo!

This means you can run a much more robust desktop on it, build better bitcoin miners and generally do more - quicker.
