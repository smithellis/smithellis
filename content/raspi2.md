# Raspberry Pi 2 - Intial Thoughts

I took a few minutes to work on the Raspberry Pi 2 last night.  It's a nice device.  The improved processor and RAM are very noticeable, making this round of the Pi a servicable desktop replacement for web, media consumption and light development.

The first thing I was interested in was trying out Ubuntu's entry into the Pi world - Ubuntu Snappy.  I'll jump right in by saying I didn't like it.  I missed apt-get too much.  The new paradigm of using the "snappy" command to install and manage packages irritated me, and I felt like I had less control that I have with apt.  The breaking out of apps vs. framworks seems clever/meaningful, but in the end I don't know that I want or need all that handholding.  Also, the repos didn't seem very robust at the moment.  

Further, I struggled a little with my wifi adapter - which is the standard edimax, so I'm not sure why I wasn't easily up and running with it.

Long story short, let's format this thing and put [Raspian][1] on it.

Poof.  Raspian is...Raspian.  All your Debian happiness condensed onto an SD card, with nice plush repos and apt-get as your default package manager.  The thing was pretty fast at boot up and in terminal - I didn't get into starting x last night, because I couldn't find a mouse to plug in (how weird is that?  How many mice must I have laying around somewhere or other at this point?).  

Anyway, I'm digging the new Pi.  Get you one. Treat yo self.
