#Pelican generated static site for SmithEllis.com

This is my pelican folder.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This site will eventually replace my Wordpress site, when I get it all hammered out.

I really like a lot of the ideas behind pelican and static site generators, and want to try it out.

##Why?

Because.
