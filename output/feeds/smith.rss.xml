&lt;p&gt;From reading around the webs, it looks like a questionable company doing questionable work.  I can find no positive write ups about them except their own.  It has all the hallmarks of something malicious, but I can't figure out what their point is (other than url spamming analytics accounts, and generating posts like this that get them hits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that's a clever way to generate traffic, even if it is shady.  I mean, if you see the bulk of your traffic coming from a domain, you just might click there to find out what's going on.  I think that is part of the irritation that semalt is getting - it's not like they are linking to your site or helping you advertise or...anything.  They are just jamming up your site with crawl after crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: since I started using &lt;a href="http://www.papertrailapp"&gt;Papertrailapp&lt;/a&gt;, I have become exceedingly aware of just how many brute force attempts are being made against every port of my home server.  What is the world??  Is this common now?  A constant barrage of ssh attacks?  I did some manual iptable work to chill them out, and then implemented fail2ban.  But I'm not seeing the results I'm after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My router's firewall appears to be much less configurable than I'd hoped, as well.  I can't seem to have it block IPs on it's own; I can, of course, turn off a bunch of ports.  But what ports I have open are opened for a reason, soo....hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not a big deal - they aren't getting in; and fail2ban slows things down on the brute force side.  But still - the amount of traffic against my ip is really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I have for now.  Smith Ellis, bringing you the freshest news about stuff you don't care about.  ShamPOW.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 07:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-09:2014/12/shady-web-crawlers-and-ssh-attacks/</guid><category>crawlers</category><category>attacks</category><category>spam</category><category>security</category></item><item><title>Programming</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/12/programming/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am a person who likes to program.  Well, not specifically the act of programming, but the act of creating something that solves a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my youth, I wrote BASIC on a Commodore 64.  I got so drawn in to that, I eventually got a book on assembly language to see how far I could take it.  Since I was like...10, I couldn't take it too far.  Plus, I was living in podunk nowhere land, and it wasn't like you could run up the street and get a few good books on Assembly Language.  If I had had Google and Codeacademy during my formitive years, lord knows what I'd be into today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, people ask me what language(s) I prefer and why all the time.  As I've aged, I've come up with the best possible answer I can give - I have a current preference for Python, but I'm not married to or utterly dogmatic about any language.  I have a strong dislike for Java, but otherwise...it's all the same to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I feel that way is that languages come and grow and go and change - you'd be a fool to adamantly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; like one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real work in being someone who codes is understanding things like program flow, variable scope and data structures.  If you have a handle on these things, you can hack things together in almost any language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am striving to be is a domain expert in one or two languages vs. a Jack of All Trades.  I think it's a good goal.  And I'd like to pick Python and/or Ruby to focus on for a while.  But my job is PHP, so there is a little disconnect there.  But I have flexibility where I am - so I can achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary.  I like creating and solving problems, and languages are just tools.  I have a lot of tools.  I tell people who ask me to not focus on the hammer, but on how to actually build the house.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-08:2014/12/programming/</guid><category>Programming</category><category>Python</category><category>Ruby</category></item><item><title>Docker on Ubuntu</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/12/docker-on-ubuntu/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Docker is a tool that lets you develop and run applications in consistent environment.  It's different from a VM (or something like Vagrant) in that it doesn't include the full OS stack.  When you think of a VM, you are thinkin about a full guest OS running in a container on your computer - Docker is a container that only holds your application and its dependencies.  Small and fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ubuntu, it's pretty easy to get up and running if you pay attention - the package is called "docker.io"...not "docker".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fire up the command line and go nuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shampow - you now have it installed.  Using Docker is beyond the scope of my write up here - but an example from the documentation goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo docker run ubuntu:14.04 /bin/echo &amp;#39;Hellow world&amp;#39;
Hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This bit of code calls the docker binary and tells it we want to run a container; specifically, we want to run an Ubuntu 14.04 image and in that image execute the /bin/echo command to print "Hello world".  Pretty cool.  When the command was executed, the container was used, and then the container was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play around and have fun.  Check out the &lt;a href="http://docs.docker.com"&gt;Docker docs&lt;/a&gt; for more/better information.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-07:2014/12/docker-on-ubuntu/</guid><category>Docker</category><category>Containers</category></item><item><title>Domains</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/12/domains/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I own a lot of domains.  I'm not a domain squatter on purpose; I've bought each domain with the intention of executing a good idea there.  And then...didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the plan goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad plan.  So I'm trying to spin up a few of my domains.  It's hard to do, it turns out.  A single site would take a bit of time, but...50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking into ways to revitalize my cool domains, and let go of the domains I can't use.  It's hard.  Think "Hoarder".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywho, I own amazing domains and I hope to share them with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-07:2014/12/domains/</guid><category>Domains</category></item><item><title>Get Bootstrap</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/get-bootstrap/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like making mobile first, accessible websites - check out bootstrap.  A twitter project that is really making webdev better, bootstrap lets you build a site that is clean and ready for all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't work for them, I'm just a fan. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-18:2014/07/get-bootstrap/</guid><category>Bootstrap</category></item><item><title>Smith Ellis: Tech Translator</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/smith-ellis-tech-translator/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Episode One&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud is a magical place.  Hosting something in "The Cloud" means that instead of hosting your services and data in places you own and control, you put it in a datacenter that someone else owns and controls; and then throw a bunch of money at them so you can put that little cloud logo on your stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also normally means that instead of traditional servers, you are putting your stuff into virtual containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses do this because they hate being responsible for their own datacenters.  They lower total cost of ownership, get a whipping boy in the form of a hosting service, and make it easy to get bought or sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Big Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data is a buzzword that usually means all the data your business generates or collects.  Once you start calling it Big Data, though, that normally means some consultants visited your CEO, or he/she read a book, and now the irritating Java Developers are getting in cahoots with the business analysts to install Hadoop on 300 servers because they are tired of Crystal Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look left, look right - neither of those guys knows how the hell to use Hadoop.  Oh, that guy does?  Better bankroll him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A look back: Java&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build once, run anywhere.  Java was the promised land for developers; write code that can work anywhere.  In reality, it's bloatware that slows down servers.  But rich guys in Silicon Valley had spent so much money adopting it that it just won't die, even though it begs for someone to kill it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it really turns out to be any good for is your android phone.  Since its battery dies every day, you never get to see the horrifying impact the Java is having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to update your desktop Java everyday, btw.  EVERY DAY.  Don't worry, the updater will remind you.  And you might get a cool new toolbar if you aren't paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-18:2014/07/smith-ellis-tech-translator/</guid><category>angst</category><category>nerd</category><category>big data</category><category>cloud</category><category>java</category></item><item><title>Too Many Interests</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/too-many-interests/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty awesome, but not perfect.  I know, it's weird to think about that...handsome, clever, bearded...I mean, what's the drawback to this guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that frustrates me about me is that I have too many interests, and many of them are expensive and time intensive.  I have three small children, so I don't get a ton of me time.  Examples of my interests are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music - making and listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scotch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resin toy making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not being outside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a busy house when you have three small children.  There is always something that must be done for someone.  Someone wanting something.  Someone crying.  Now, I love my kids guys.  Don't even start in with all that.  All I'm saying is that if you have 3,000 hobbies and three kids, you aren't going to do those hobbies very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's to be done?  I've considered giving up sleeping, but my eyes just close at some point and jack that plan right up.  Thanks, Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there is my plight.  Too many interests, not enough time.  I know one day the kids will all be grown and I'll be sad they are off at college and my house is empty.  I know it.  But meanwhile, how do you fit it all in?  What do other people do?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 21:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-09:2014/07/too-many-interests/</guid><category>linux</category><category>hobbies</category></item><item><title>Expression Engine</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/expression-engine/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;At my new job we use Expression Engine for our CMS; a for-profit PHP based piece of software from &lt;a href="" title="http://www.ellislab.com"&gt;EllisLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never messed with it prior to this job.  Prior to this, I've used Wordpress/Joomla and the proprietary platform we had at Digital Insight - Web Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing the reason I've never monkeyed with Expression Engine is that it costs money, whereas the others (Wordpress, Drupal, et al) are free to use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my initial impressions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to install and use.  This is always important.  I've had the opportunity to set up a dev server and a test implementation, and both installs were painless.  It's your standard "unzip here, go to the installer in your browser, fill out form, delete install directory" type deal.  Once you log in, you see a decent (kind of dated looking, but...) control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes sense.  You have content stored in what they call "Channels" and you have Design items, which are your templates.  It uses a proprietary templating system to pull content in and manipulate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows fairly robust user management.  You can set up, limit and manage users easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility - there are modules and plugins galore.  Most of them are pay to play, though - so that's a bummer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, overall, it's not a bad CMS.  If the licensing wasn't so costly, and the modules so costly, it might have a wider adoption out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-09:2014/07/expression-engine/</guid><category>EE</category><category>ExpressionEngine</category></item><item><title>On Being Smith Ellis</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/on-being-smith-ellis/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis was born Benjamin Ellis, down in Florida.  He grew up in Georgia; mostly Stockbridge GA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis used to write, but has cooled his jets on that a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis now enjoys programming, painting, resin toy making, electronics, robots, music making/listening and playing with his three children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis was middle class, then he was poor, then he was rich, then he was middle class.&lt;/p&gt;

It's really clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the complexities of a robust CMS, you get a website composed of flat files.  Deployable almost anywhere, fast and built to last.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You compose you articles or pages in the editor of your choice, and you can use Markdown - which is awesome.  After you've dropped your new page/article in the appropriate folder, a simple command generates your site.  You can even have that simple command generate and deploy your site!  Booya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as Paul McLanahan told me, we go backwards to go forward.  Flat file sites are the old future. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 10:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-08:2014/07/pelican-is-good/</guid><category>pelican</category><category>coding</category><category>cms</category></item><item><title>Ember.js, the death of the CMS, and sundry other things</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/07/emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a movement these days away from having a CMS power your site, to again having flat files stored in folders. The flat files are generated by a tool that combines your markdown/html pages with templates. Very cool and clever stuff, and probably a great answer for many of the use cases out there for a personal site. I’ve been playing with &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;; really simple and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been messing with &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember.js"&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;, which is a JS based MVC framework. It seems to be really geared towards single page, UI heavy web applications. It gives logical structure to these types of apps, while making things like JSON parsing and API calls easier. The flip side – it seems to make building simple things a little more complex than just chucking jquery at your html. The example todo app made me feel a little uncertain about the whole thing – why should i have a slew of js includes, extended classes and new syntax to learn just to make text boxes editable? I ask that with a grain of salt, because I think I could see this being a great answer for an application that reaches a certain level of complexity; and the “todo” app was just for demo/learning purposes….anyway, verdict is still out by I do like learning it. So I’ll keep doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve messed a little with &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’m planning a node project right now. It’s really awesome; so I’m going to figure out something to do with it. I’m getting lazy tonight, but I’ll make a separate post about it later on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-04:2014/07/emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things/</guid><category>emberjs</category><category>code</category><category>coding</category><category>nodejs</category><category>pelican</category></item><item><title>How I Fixed Samba</title><link>http://smithellis.com/2014/06/how-i-fixed-samba/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry, rebuilt my site and broke this post!
