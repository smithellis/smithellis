&lt;p&gt;I had never messed with it prior to this job.  Prior to this, I've used Wordpress/Joomla and the proprietary platform we had at Digital Insight - Web Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing the reason I've never monkeyed with Expression Engine is that it costs money, whereas the others (Wordpress, Drupal, et al) are free to use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my initial impressions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to install and use.  This is always important.  I've had the opportunity to set up a dev server and a test implementation, and both installs were painless.  It's your standard "unzip here, go to the installer in your browser, fill out form, delete install directory" type deal.  Once you log in, you see a decent (kind of dated looking, but...) control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes sense.  You have content stored in what they call "Channels" and you have Design items, which are your templates.  It uses a proprietary templating system to pull content in and manipulate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows fairly robust user management.  You can set up, limit and manage users easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility - there are modules and plugins galore.  Most of them are pay to play, though - so that's a bummer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, overall, it's not a bad CMS.  If the licensing wasn't so costly, and the modules so costly, it might have a wider adoption out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.smithellis.com,2014-07-09:expression-engine.html</guid><category>EE</category><category>ExpressionEngine</category></item><item><title>On Being Smith Ellis</title><link>http://www.smithellis.com/on-being-smith-ellis.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis was born Benjamin Ellis, down in Florida.  He grew up in Georgia; mostly Stockbridge GA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis used to write, but has cooled his jets on that a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis now enjoys programming, painting, resin toy making, electronics, robots, music making/listening and playing with his three children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis was middle class, then he was poor, then he was rich, then he was middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis' wife has never tried to kill him in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 07:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.smithellis.com,2014-07-09:on-being-smith-ellis.html</guid><category>smith ellis</category><category>smith</category><category>ellis</category></item><item><title>Pelican is Good</title><link>http://www.smithellis.com/pelican-is-good.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've just gotten off the ground with the &lt;a href="" title="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican Static Site Generator&lt;/a&gt;.  It's really clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the complexities of a robust CMS, you get a website composed of flat files.  Deployable almost anywhere, fast and built to last.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You compose you articles or pages in the editor of your choice, and you can use Markdown - which is awesome.  After you've dropped your new page/article in the appropriate folder, a simple command generates your site.  You can even have that simple command generate and deploy your site!  Booya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as Paul McLanahan told me, we go backwards to go forward.  Flat file sites are the old future. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 10:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.smithellis.com,2014-07-08:pelican-is-good.html</guid><category>pelican</category><category>coding</category><category>cms</category></item><item><title>Ember.js, the death of the CMS, and sundry other things</title><link>http://www.smithellis.com/emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a movement these days away from having a CMS power your site, to again having flat files stored in folders. The flat files are generated by a tool that combines your markdown/html pages with templates. Very cool and clever stuff, and probably a great answer for many of the use cases out there for a personal site. I’ve been playing with &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;; really simple and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been messing with &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember.js"&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;, which is a JS based MVC framework. It seems to be really geared towards single page, UI heavy web applications. It gives logical structure to these types of apps, while making things like JSON parsing and API calls easier. The flip side – it seems to make building simple things a little more complex than just chucking jquery at your html. The example todo app made me feel a little uncertain about the whole thing – why should i have a slew of js includes, extended classes and new syntax to learn just to make text boxes editable? I ask that with a grain of salt, because I think I could see this being a great answer for an application that reaches a certain level of complexity; and the “todo” app was just for demo/learning purposes….anyway, verdict is still out by I do like learning it. So I’ll keep doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve messed a little with &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’m planning a node project right now. It’s really awesome; so I’m going to figure out something to do with it. I’m getting lazy tonight, but I’ll make a separate post about it later on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.smithellis.com,2014-07-04:emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things.html</guid><category>emberjs</category><category>code</category><category>coding</category><category>nodejs</category><category>pelican</category></item></channel></rss>
