For this site, &lt;a href="http://smithellis.com/" title="Smith Ellis"&gt;a blog for Smith Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, my only plan it to generate content that might be interesting for technologists and web nerds.  But for my other properties, I'm balancing time vs. value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;ThriftKid&lt;/a&gt; isn't going to have constantly updated content.  Once I get it set up like I want it, the only content (right now) I plan to change will be adding products or updating resources.  I don't foresee a blog or a news feed there.  I think &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;ThriftKid&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea, and could generate revenue - but I need to figure out how to make it better and more valuable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs content - real content and advice.  And it needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about &lt;a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" title="Tim Ferriss"&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt;, who I criticize and admire all in the same breath.  He knows how to promote, and now that he's gotten "critical mass" so that anything he talks about gets a wide audience.  Famous friends, hard work a few books don't hurt.  But, let's assume I don't have any famous friends or books.  Looks like hard work is all I can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;ThriftKid&lt;/a&gt;, I'm going to keep updating and improving the site.  Keep adding real value.  I really do want to help &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;increase kids fiscal literacy&lt;/a&gt;.  But I need to find some forums and communities to get involved with to help grow the brand and share the resources with.  And maybe get some help with content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still open for ideas on &lt;a href="http://meanmurmustard.com/" title="MeanMrMustard"&gt;MeanMrMustard&lt;/a&gt;, though.  Such a cool name, it's a shame it lacks direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, more later!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sites"></category><category term="monetization"></category><category term="seo"></category><category term="experiment"></category><category term="development"></category><category term="hosting"></category></entry><entry><title>Sites I Own and What I'm Doing With Them</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2015/02/sites-i-own-and-what-im-doing-with-them/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-09T07:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2015-02-09:2015/02/sites-i-own-and-what-im-doing-with-them/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Squat No More, Let's Do Something&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I own a bunch of domains, as I mentioned in a &lt;a href="http://smithellis.com/2014/12/domains/" title="Domains I Own"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smithellis.com/" title="Smith Ellis"&gt;smithellis.com&lt;/a&gt; - the home page of &lt;a href="http://smithellis.com/" title="Smith Ellis"&gt;smith ellis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nerdpocalypse.com/" title="Nerdpocalypse"&gt;nerdpocalypse.com&lt;/a&gt; - a floundering &lt;a href="http://nerdpocalypse.com/" title="Nerdpocalypse"&gt;tech site&lt;/a&gt; that should be awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;thriftkid.com&lt;/a&gt; - a cool site to &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;help kids learn about money and finance&lt;/a&gt;.  It's pretty sparse right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lunchpal.com/" title="LunchPal"&gt;lunchpal.com&lt;/a&gt; - this was going to be &lt;a href="http://lunchpal.com/" title="LunchPal"&gt;a resource to help you plan your work lunches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meanmurmustard.com/" title="MeanMrMustard"&gt;meanmrmustard.com&lt;/a&gt; - a novely &lt;a href="http://meanmurmustard.com/" title="MeanMrMustard"&gt;Beatles song website&lt;/a&gt; that has...no direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these are just a few.  There are sooo many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the plan, Stan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided last year that I was going to work hard to get content up at as many of my sites as possible, and see what shook out.  In other words, let's at least get the sites online and available...that's a good first step.  You might argue it's the cart before the horse - a presence without a mission.  I argue that eating a frog requires that you start early in the morning.  I'm getting ready to eat this frog.  Plus, I'm working hard to get my programming chops back up to expert - these sites are letting me try new technology out.  Like Django, Flask, and Pelican.  And letting me have a reason to mess with Docker and Emberjs and other tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; like to make a buck or two.  I figure if I can make enough money on my sites to pay for hosting, this will have been a good year. If I build a brand or two, or a following of any sort, then even better.  And if I can actually help people like I want to do with &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;thriftkid&lt;/a&gt;, then all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where I Am In The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://smithellis.com/" title="Smith Ellis"&gt;smithellis.com&lt;/a&gt; up and online.  And active.  I have &lt;a href="http://nerdpocalypse.com/" title="Nerdpocalypse"&gt;nerdpocalypse.com&lt;/a&gt; online and available.  It's terrible right now.  I have &lt;a href="http://thriftkid.com/" title="ThriftKid"&gt;thriftkid.com&lt;/a&gt; online and available, and it's somewhat useful...and hopefully will grow.  Lunchpal.com and Meanmrmustard.com are dead in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will come along with me as I explore making these sites into something useful and valuable.  If you have ideas, you can ping me on twitter ( @smith_ellis ).  You can also find me on Facebook or Google+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I drive into my driveway, the house should know I'm home quick enough to open the garage door.  I drive into my garage, and my phone should start uploading my documents, music, media to my home server with cloud replication.  This should happen every time, without me doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door unlocks.  I go in, I put my phone in a slot.  File synching continues, the house (via my Amazon Echo or Jarvis like device) greets me.  And it's listening for me to greet and speak to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone has well over two terabytes of storage.  Did I mention that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, any room I walk into before bedtime lights up.  After I tell the house I'm going to bed, only night lights light up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can speak to the house from anywhere.  Any file or document I've touched ever is available to me on any tv or monitor in the house.  Every seat in the house has a keyboard available within reach, in case there is productive work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house knows how many people are in the house and where.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house monitors the sounds of our hearts and respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there is more, but let's start there.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="automation"></category><category term="echo"></category><category term="home automation"></category><category term="jarvis"></category><category term="micasaverde"></category></entry><entry><title>Amazon Echo is a revolution</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2015/02/amazon-echo-is-a-revolution/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-05T07:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2015-02-05:2015/02/amazon-echo-is-a-revolution/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Amazon Echo is a Disruptive Device&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know a device is disruptive?  When you can't go back to the way you used to do things before you had the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, the Amazon Echo is a metal tube that contains an array of microphones and speakers.  After you get it set up, you can talk to it and have it perform several tasks for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can play music from your Amazon library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can play music from Amazon Prime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can read you the news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can tell you the weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can tell you a joke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can repeat something you say to it ( this is a gimmick at the moment, but fun sometimes )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can adjust it's volume on demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add things to your shopping list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add things to your to-do list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it - I get up in the morning and as it the weather.  I ask it to read the news while I make coffee.  I ask it to play music when I'm cooking or hanging out with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids love it - they shout at it to tell them jokes (all the jokes are tame "dad jokes", so no fear here) and they ask it to play kids music.  And, unfortunately, they ask it to play Hamster Dance and the soundtrack from Frozen all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find now is that I get in my car and shout "Alexa" - like the device is with me in my car.  It's weird.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Amazon got this product so right is a combination of two things - the microphones &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; very well.  They hear you.  The computer understands me 99% of the time.  And the device responds quick enough that you aren't frustrated with it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers are more than adequate for a bedroom or living room music player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I love the Amazon Echo.  Get you one.  Treat yo self.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="amazon"></category><category term="echo"></category><category term="automation"></category></entry><entry><title>Why big companies fail at agility</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/12/why-big-companies-fail-at-agility/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-16T07:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-16:2014/12/why-big-companies-fail-at-agility/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've briefly retired from being a manager at big tech companies.  And by retired, I mean I've decided to more hands on work in programming and less Powerpoint presentations.  But I wanted to share some thoughts about big companies, and why they get stuck with substandard and outdated offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first struggle a big company has is that it has "right sized" its staff to the point that everyone already has three jobs.  When an employee is over maximum capacity on day to day duties, they aren't going to be shining lights of creativity - especially for the benefit of the company.  Most smart people (the very people you want creating &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;) will see a bad situation at work, and use that creative energy to enact an escape plan.  That means hoarding ideas, hoarding that extra 10% effort, and looking for a way to leverage their talents for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see big tech companies saying things like "we give employees 10% time to work on whatever they want".  It's really untrue.  There may be a nest of golden kids at corporate who had 10% time, but the reality for everyone else is a 12 hour day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have employees who are overworked and planning their escape (and many won't ever leave or act on their ideas, which is actually worse in my opinion than giving the ideas to corporate - an unbaked idea cheats the world!).  Meanwhile, the PR machine at a big company will keep singing the song about innovation, supporting ideas, etc.  But really - really really - they will use up the people who do have ideas, and the rewards will be small for that person (if any).  In fact, most of the time, you will be saddled with your cool idea and your three other jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that PR machine, the same one that is supposed to be inspiring, becomes something of a cancer in the business instead of a motivator.  Employees see the disconnect between the words and the deeds, and there is no way to hold on to that cognitive dissonance and feel good.  It just doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="silicon valley"></category><category term="big companies"></category><category term="tech companies"></category></entry><entry><title>Tech communities need people who are welcoming</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/12/tech-communities-need-people-who-are-welcoming/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-11T07:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-11:2014/12/tech-communities-need-people-who-are-welcoming/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I see something in the tech community that bothers me; it happens far too often.

What is it that drives some people to just be arrogant?  Why join a community, or respond to a post, if you aren't willing to be a positive part of that community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been around the block, and it is &lt;em&gt;infuriating&lt;/em&gt; when someone pops up on the Python group and says something like "Python can make numbers go plus?  How install Python?".  I'm not talking about those guys.  Be mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading around the webs, it looks like a questionable company doing questionable work.  I can find no positive write ups about them except their own.  It has all the hallmarks of something malicious, but I can't figure out what their point is (other than url spamming analytics accounts, and generating posts like this that get them hits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that's a clever way to generate traffic, even if it is shady.  I mean, if you see the bulk of your traffic coming from a domain, you just might click there to find out what's going on.  I think that is part of the irritation that semalt is getting - it's not like they are linking to your site or helping you advertise or...anything.  They are just jamming up your site with crawl after crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: since I started using &lt;a href="http://www.papertrailapp"&gt;Papertrailapp&lt;/a&gt;, I have become exceedingly aware of just how many brute force attempts are being made against every port of my home server.  What in the world??  Is this common now?  A constant barrage of ssh attacks?  I did some manual iptables work to chill them out, and then implemented fail2ban; but I'm not seeing the results I'm after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My router's firewall appears to be much less configurable than I'd hoped, as well.  I can't seem to have it block IPs on its own; I can, of course, turn off a bunch of ports.  But what ports I have open are opened for a reason, soo....hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not a big deal - they aren't getting in; and fail2ban slows things down on the brute force side.  But still - the amount of traffic against my ip is really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, not specifically the act of programming, but the act of creating something that solves a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my youth, I wrote BASIC on a Commodore 64.  I got so drawn in to that, I eventually got a book on assembly language to see how far I could take it.  Since I was like...10, I couldn't take it too far.  Plus, I was living in podunk nowhere land, and it wasn't like you could run up the street and get a few good books on Assembly Language.  If I had had Google and Codeacademy during my formitive years, lord knows what I'd be into today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, people ask me what language(s) I prefer and why all the time.  As I've aged, I've come up with the best possible answer I can give - I have a current preference for Python, but I'm not married to or utterly dogmatic about any language.  I have a strong dislike for Java, but otherwise...it's all the same to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I feel that way is that languages come and grow and go and change - you'd be a fool to adamantly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; like one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real work in being someone who codes is understanding things like program flow, variable scope and data structures.  If you have a handle on these things, you can hack things together in almost any language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am striving to be is a domain expert in one or two languages vs. a Jack of All Trades.  I think it's a good goal.  And I'd like to pick Python and/or Ruby to focus on for a while.  But my job is PHP, so there is a little disconnect there.  But I have flexibility where I am - so I can achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary.  I like creating and solving problems, and languages are just tools.  I have a lot of tools.  I tell people who ask me to not focus on the hammer, but on how to actually build the house.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Programming"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Ruby"></category></entry><entry><title>Docker on Ubuntu</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/12/docker-on-ubuntu/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-07T20:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-12-07:2014/12/docker-on-ubuntu/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Docker is a tool that lets you develop and run applications in a consistent environment.  It's different from a VM (or something like Vagrant) in that it doesn't include the full OS stack.  When you think of a VM, you are thinking about a full guest OS running in a container on your computer - Docker is a container that only holds your application and its dependencies.  Small and fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu, it's pretty easy to get up and running if you pay attention - the package is called "docker.io"...not "docker".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fire up the command line and go nuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shampow - you now have it installed.  Using Docker is beyond the scope of my write up here - but an example from the documentation goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo docker run ubuntu:14.04 /bin/echo &amp;#39;Hello world&amp;#39;
Hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This bit of code calls the docker binary and tells it we want to run a container; specifically, we want to run an Ubuntu 14.04 image and in that image execute the /bin/echo command to print "Hello world".  Pretty cool.  When the command was executed, the container was used, and then the container was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play around and have fun.

&lt;h1&gt;The Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud is a magical place.  Hosting something in "The Cloud" means that instead of hosting your services and data in places you own and control, you put it in a datacenter that someone else owns and controls; and then throw a bunch of money at them so you can put that little cloud logo on your stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also normally means that instead of traditional servers, you are putting your stuff into virtual containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses do this because they hate being responsible for their own datacenters.  They lower total cost of ownership, get a whipping boy in the form of a hosting service, and make it easy to get bought or sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Big Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data is a buzzword that usually means all the data your business generates or collects.  Once you start calling it Big Data, though, that normally means some consultants visited your CEO, or he/she read a book, and now the irritating Java Developers are getting in cahoots with the business analysts to install Hadoop on 300 servers because they are tired of Crystal Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look left, look right - neither of those guys knows how the hell to use Hadoop.  Oh, that guy does?  Better bankroll him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A look back: Java&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build once, run anywhere.  Java was the promised land for developers; write code that can work anywhere.  In reality, it's bloatware that slows down servers.  But rich guys in Silicon Valley had spent so much money adopting it that it just won't die, even though it begs for someone to kill it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it really turns out to be any good for is your android phone.  Since its battery dies every day, you never get to see the horrifying impact the Java is having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to update your desktop Java everyday, btw.  EVERY DAY.  Don't worry, the updater will remind you.  And you might get a cool new toolbar if you aren't paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

I know, it's weird to think about that...handsome, clever, bearded...I mean, what's the drawback to this guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that frustrates me about me is that I have too many interests, and many of them are expensive and time intensive.  I have three small children, so I don't get a ton of me time.  Examples of my interests are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music - making and listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scotch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resin toy making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not being outside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a busy house when you have three small children.  There is always something that must be done for someone.  Someone wanting something.  Someone crying.  Now, I love my kids guys.  Don't even start in with all that.  All I'm saying is that if you have 3,000 hobbies and three kids, you aren't going to do those hobbies very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's to be done?  I've considered giving up sleeping, but my eyes just close at some point and jack that plan right up.  Thanks, Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there is my plight.  Too many interests, not enough time.  I know one day the kids will all be grown and I'll be sad they are off at college and my house is empty.  I know it.  But meanwhile, how do you fit it all in?  What do other people do?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="hobbies"></category></entry><entry><title>Expression Engine</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/07/expression-engine/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-09T09:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-09:2014/07/expression-engine/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At my new job we use Expression Engine for our CMS; a for-profit PHP based piece of software from &lt;a href="" title="http://www.ellislab.com"&gt;EllisLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never messed with it prior to this job.  Prior to this, I've used Wordpress/Joomla and the proprietary platform we had at Digital Insight - Web Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing the reason I've never monkeyed with Expression Engine is that it costs money, whereas the others (Wordpress, Drupal, et al) are free to use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my initial impressions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to install and use.  This is always important.  I've had the opportunity to set up a dev server and a test implementation, and both installs were painless.  It's your standard "unzip here, go to the installer in your browser, fill out form, delete install directory" type deal.  Once you log in, you see a decent (kind of dated looking, but...) control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes sense.  You have content stored in what they call "Channels" and you have Design items, which are your templates.  It uses a proprietary templating system to pull content in and manipulate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows fairly robust user management.  You can set up, limit and manage users easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility - there are modules and plugins galore.  Most of them are pay to play, though - so that's a bummer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, overall, it's not a bad CMS.  If the licensing wasn't so costly, and the modules so costly, it might have a wider adoption out there.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="EE"></category><category term="ExpressionEngine"></category></entry><entry><title>On Being Smith Ellis</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/07/on-being-smith-ellis/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-09T07:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-09:2014/07/on-being-smith-ellis/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Smith Ellis was born Benjamin Ellis, down in Florida.

It's really clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the complexities of a robust CMS, you get a website composed of flat files.  Deployable almost anywhere, fast and built to last.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You compose you articles or pages in the editor of your choice, and you can use Markdown - which is awesome.  After you've dropped your new page/article in the appropriate folder, a simple command generates your site.  You can even have that simple command generate and deploy your site!  Booya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as Paul McLanahan told me, we go backwards to go forward.  Flat file sites are the old future. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="cms"></category></entry><entry><title>Ember.js, the death of the CMS, and sundry other things</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/07/emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-04T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-07-04:2014/07/emberjs-the-death-of-the-cms-and-sundry-other-things/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a movement these days away from having a CMS power your site, to again having flat files stored in folders. The flat files are generated by a tool that combines your markdown/html pages with templates. Very cool and clever stuff, and probably a great answer for many of the use cases out there for a personal site. I’ve been playing with &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;; really simple and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been messing with &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember.js"&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;, which is a JS based MVC framework. It seems to be really geared towards single page, UI heavy web applications. It gives logical structure to these types of apps, while making things like JSON parsing and API calls easier. The flip side – it seems to make building simple things a little more complex than just chucking jquery at your html. The example todo app made me feel a little uncertain about the whole thing – why should i have a slew of js includes, extended classes and new syntax to learn just to make text boxes editable? I ask that with a grain of salt, because I think I could see this being a great answer for an application that reaches a certain level of complexity; and the “todo” app was just for demo/learning purposes….anyway, verdict is still out by I do like learning it. So I’ll keep doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve messed a little with &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’m planning a node project right now. It’s really awesome; so I’m going to figure out something to do with it. I’m getting lazy tonight, but I’ll make a separate post about it later on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emberjs"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="nodejs"></category><category term="pelican"></category></entry><entry><title>How I Fixed Samba</title><link href="http://smithellis.com/2014/06/how-i-fixed-samba/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Smith</name></author><id>tag:smithellis.com,2014-06-09:2014/06/how-i-fixed-samba/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry, rebuilt my site and broke this post!
